# Regression of House Prices: Brick, Mortar and Machine Learning 

One of the most common use cases of regression techniques is to predict prices in markets such as the stock market. In this case, I will use Machine Learning and Data Analytics to guess the price of different properties alongside Ames, Iowa, EEUU. The challenge of this dataset may be its huge number of explanatory variables, but this is also one of its main virtues, as we might get a glance of what actually drives the price of a property and what makes this indicator vary from observations located on a certain area. 

On a business case, the output of this kind of models might be able to detect underpriced properties and invest on them, or to check if a property you own is above price and convert it into liquidity to make wiser investments with that extra cashflow.

## Installation of the environment

You can follow up this notebook in your machine by downloading Anaconda and then running the following command in the terminal:

```shell
conda env create --file house-prices.yml
```

This should have you prepared to run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` in the terminal and then running the mentioned code using that familiar interface.
